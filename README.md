# Inverse-filter

A set of functions (MATLAB) for inverse filtering of signals acquired by the Neuralynx recording system in hybrid AC/DC mode

IFtheor.m can be used for basic reconstruction using nominal filter values; signal vector and sampling rate are needed as input data
IFtheor.m can be used for reconstruction using ko and tau parameters measured experimentally
