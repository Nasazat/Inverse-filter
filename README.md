# Inverse-filter

A set of functions (MATLAB) for inverse filtering of signals acquired by the Neuralynx recording system in hybrid AC/DC mode

IFtheor.m is used for basic reconstruction using nominal filter values; filtered signal vector and sampling rate are needed as input data


IFempir.m is used for reconstruction using parameters k<sub>0</sub> and &tau; measured experimentally; filtered signal vector and sampling rate are needed as input data
